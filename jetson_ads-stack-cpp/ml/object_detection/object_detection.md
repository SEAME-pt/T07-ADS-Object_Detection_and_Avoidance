# Hybrid U-Net-based YOLOv1 Model on Jetson Nano

This document outlines the software dependencies required to run the hybrid U-Net-based YOLOv1 model, which performs both object detection and semantic segmentation in a single architecture, optimized for the Jetson Nano. It compares the usage of this single hybrid model against using two separate models (e.g., standard YOLO for detection and U-Net for segmentation) on the Jetson Nano, considering resource constraints, performance, and deployment.


## Comparison: Single Hybrid Model vs. Two Separate Models on Jetson Nano

Since you are already using the hybrid U-Net-based YOLOv1 model for both detection and segmentation, this comparison evaluates the advantages and trade-offs of using a single model versus deploying two separate models (e.g., standard YOLO for detection and U-Net for segmentation) on the Jetson Nano, a resource-constrained device with limited memory (4GB or 8GB) and compute power (128-core Maxwell GPU).

### Single Hybrid U-Net-based YOLOv1 Model
**Overview**:
- A single model combining U-Net for feature extraction and segmentation with a YOLOv1-inspired detection head for object detection.
- Outputs bounding boxes (with class probabilities and confidence scores) and semantic segmentation masks in a single forward pass.
- Optimized for Jetson Nano with reduced computational complexity.

**Key Features**:
- **Architecture**: U-Net backbone with downsampling/upsampling paths, a bottleneck, and a detection head predicting a 7x7 grid (default) with 2 bounding boxes per cell and 20 classes.
- **Detection Head**: Reduced channels (512 → 128 → 64), `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` for fixed grid output, `LeakyReLU`, and batch normalization for efficiency.
- **Training**: Supports pre-trained weights, with frozen U-Net layers (except detection head and grid adjustment) to reduce training overhead.
- **Loss**: Custom YOLOv1 loss (`YoloLoss`) for detection (coordinates, confidence, classification) plus segmentation loss (not shown but assumed in your implementation).
- **Output**: Dual outputs (detection: `[batch, S, S, C + B*5]`, segmentation: `[batch, out_channels, H, W]`).
- **Optimizations for Jetson Nano**: Dropout (0.1–0.3), reduced channels, and mixed-precision training (AMP) to lower memory and compute demands.

**Usage on Jetson Nano**:
- **Resource Usage**:
  - **Memory**: Moderate to high due to U-Net’s upsampling path and dual outputs.
  - **Compute**: Moderate, with optimizations reducing FLOPs in the detection head.
  - **Inference Time**: Slower than detection-only models (e.g., ~50–100ms per image, depending on batch size and resolution).
- **Pros**:
  - Single model simplifies deployment, reducing overhead from managing two models (e.g., separate weights, pipelines).
  - Unified feature extraction avoids redundant computations (shared U-Net backbone for detection and segmentation).
  - Lower disk storage (single weights file, ~50–100MB depending on configuration).
  - Easier integration into applications needing both tasks (e.g., robotics, autonomous navigation).
- **Cons**:
  - Higher memory footprint than a detection-only model due to segmentation.
  - Inference slower than optimized YOLO models due to dual-task processing.
  - Limited to tasks where detection and segmentation are both required, potentially overkill for detection-only use cases.
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (`torch`, `torchvision`, `tqdm`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `pillow`).

**Use Case**:
- Applications on Jetson Nano requiring both object detection and segmentation, such as identifying and segmenting objects in real-time (e.g., obstacle detection and mapping in robotics).

### Two Separate Models (Standard YOLO + U-Net)
**Overview**:
- Two models: one for object detection (e.g., YOLOv1 or a lightweight version like YOLOv5-Tiny) and one for segmentation (e.g., U-Net or a lightweight variant like MobileUnet).
- Each model is specialized, potentially offering better performance for its specific task but requiring separate inference pipelines.

**Key Features**:
- **YOLO (Detection)**:
  - Architecture: Convolutional layers (YOLOv1) or CSP-Darknet (YOLOv5-Tiny), predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities.
  - Output: Bounding boxes `[batch, S, S, C + B*5]` (e.g., 7x7 grid, 2 boxes, 20 classes).
  - Loss: YOLO loss (coordinates, confidence, classification).
- **U-Net (Segmentation)**:
  - Architecture: Encoder-decoder with skip connections for pixel-level segmentation.
  - Output: Segmentation masks `[batch, out_channels, H, W]`.
  - Loss: Typically cross-entropy or Dice loss for segmentation.
- **Training**: Each model trained separately, potentially with pre-trained weights for transfer learning.
- **Optimizations for Jetson Nano**: Lightweight versions (e.g., YOLOv5-Tiny, MobileUnet) reduce resource usage.

**Usage on Jetson Nano**:
- **Resource Usage**:
  - **Memory**: Higher than the hybrid model.
  - **Compute**: Higher due to separate forward passes, with redundant feature extraction (no shared backbone).
  - **Inference Time**: Slower overall (e.g., ~30–50ms for YOLOv5-Tiny + ~50–80ms for U-Net, totaling ~80–130ms per image).
- **Pros**:
  - Specialized models may achieve slightly better accuracy for individual tasks (e.g., YOLOv5-Tiny for detection, U-Net for segmentation).
  - Flexible deployment: Use only one model if the other task is not needed.
  - Easier to swap models (e.g., upgrade to YOLOv8-Nano or a different segmentation model).
- **Cons**:
  - Increased memory and compute demands strain Jetson Nano’s limited resources, potentially causing out-of-memory errors.
  - Redundant feature extraction increases latency and power consumption.
  - Complex deployment: Two sets of weights (~20–50MB for YOLO + ~30–80MB for U-Net), separate inference pipelines, and synchronization of outputs.
  - Higher maintenance overhead (e.g., updating two models, managing dependencies).
- **Dependencies**:
  - YOLO: `torch`, `torchvision`, `tqdm`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `pillow`. Modern versions (e.g., YOLOv5) may add `opencv-python`, `pyyaml`, `matplotlib`.
  - U-Net: Similar to hybrid model (`torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `pillow`).
  - Example for YOLOv5 + U-Net:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision tqdm opencv-python pyyaml matplotlib numpy pandas pillow
    ```

**Use Case**:
- Applications where tasks are independent or require the highest accuracy for detection or segmentation separately, but less practical on Jetson Nano due to resource constraints.

## Recommendations for Jetson Nano
- **Use the Hybrid Model**:
  - The single hybrid model is better suited for Jetson Nano due to its unified architecture, lower memory footprint, and reduced inference time compared to running two models.
  - Optimizations (reduced channels, AMP, dropout) make it practical for real-time applications with constrained resources.
  - Simplifies deployment and maintenance, critical for embedded systems.
- **When to Consider Two Models**:
  - If one task (e.g., detection) is needed more frequently, a lightweight YOLOv5-Tiny could be used alone to save resources.
  - If absolute accuracy is critical and Jetson Nano’s resources can be supplemented (e.g., via model pruning or INT8 quantization), two specialized models might be viable.
  - However, this approach is less practical without significant optimization (e.g., TensorRT conversion).

## Additional Notes
- **Hybrid Model**:
  - Ensure dataset includes both bounding box annotations and segmentation masks (e.g., VOC format with CSV files).
  - Tune batch size (e.g., reduce to 8 or 4) if memory errors occur on Jetson Nano.
  - Use TensorRT for further optimization (convert model to ONNX, then TensorRT engine) to reduce inference time.
  - Check `train.py` for paths to images, labels, and pre-trained weights.
- **Two Models**:
  - YOLOv5-Tiny or YOLOv8-Nano are recommended for detection due to their lightweight design.
  - For segmentation, consider MobileUnet or Fast-SCNN to reduce resource usage.
  - Requires careful pipeline design to synchronize outputs and manage memory (e.g., sequential inference to avoid OOM).
  - Modern YOLO implementations (e.g., Ultralytics YOLOv5) have their own `requirements.txt`—merge with U-Net dependencies.
- **Environment Setup**:
  - Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - For Jetson Nano, install JetPack SDK (e.g., 4.6 or 5.0) for CUDA/cuDNN support and use NVIDIA’s PyTorch wheels.
